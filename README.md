# Notes
This Project is just a hobby, its not intendent to be playable like the TCG, these cards is mostly accurate to the original material in some way.
I accept any critic, suggestion or feedback to doing better or correct error, but i will not change how exatcly these cards works specifically to be viewed as TCG cards.
